Bixos was established in the USA in January 2021.

Our goal is to develop technologies that enable investors to make safe and stable profits in the crypto market. To do so, we need to stay up to date with the latest trends and master them rapidly. The latest trends we are investing in today are Staking, DeFi Farming, and DeFi Liquidation. And we have already built our technologies to make safe and stable profits from them and help investors do so, too.
